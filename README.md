Through the use of 5 stations’ data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level dataset, we
attempt to answer three research questions: 1) “How have the sea levels changed throughout the
years in Tokyo, Japan?” 2) “How does this compare to the other three most densely populated
cities in Japan?”, and 3) “Is it possible to predict future tidal trends using the data available?”. A
literature review is considered to include this research’s place in the wider literature. After data
cleaning and EDA, analysis of seasonality and stationarity of the time series was carried out to
understand the current trends. Autoregressive integrated moving average, and autocorrelation
function were used to create a model for forecasting the Tokyo mean sea level trends in the next
decade and attempt to answer the last research questions. Results show that the sea level values
are slowly ascending, predictive models were created to answer the second and third questions.
Implications for local populations and limitations of the dataset are discussed.
